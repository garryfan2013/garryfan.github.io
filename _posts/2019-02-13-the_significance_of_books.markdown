### The significance of books

I like watching movies and TV Series a lot, no matter in cinema or through online channels, but recently I spend a lot of time on reading books , in terms of which, I mean here with a broad sense, not only the tranditional paper books but also the electronic ones e.g. Kindle ebooks.

I noticed on myself an interesting phenomenon about the difference between books and those video materials composed of motion pictures. The duration of watching video is fixed commonly according to the duration of that specified video clip. But the duration of reading a book is dynamic and various according to the strategy adopted with it. 

The superficial description of the phenomenon also implies the huge significance of the printed media , that you probably need deep thinking while reading, which can't be attained through watching video -- the motion picture media -- due to its squeezed timeline which wouldn't allow the existence of deep thinking. One perhaps, would be entertained and amazed by the visually spectacular scenes, nevertheless soon afterwards, all the images and sounds will fade out and you wouldn't even think about it any more.

Thus having watched a lot of movies, it seems nothing has been attained except for some famous lines and those gorgeous actresses.The property of continuity of video media would be damaged and the effect would be largely shrinked, if we pause the play and think for a while. It's relatively easy to stop and restart for books.Though good and valuable as it is, people always(at least it is true on my own case) prefer to watching rather than reading, mostly due to the mental strength accompanied with reading and one always incline to the easy and effortless choice. No pay no gain, simple but infallible, one should be aware of the consequence and the suffering in the future, while choosing the easy path. In terms of reading, although the recompense which you probably could not feel or perceive in a short period, is a consequnce of long term cumulation, but it worth trying and would not fail you. 

So, keep reading, spend less time on watching which would be a good choice solely for killing time.
